### Notes About Qual

* d3 transitions run only while page is 'active', while leaflet view reset to see whole path happens at set time, regardless of whether the view is being looked at. So, if I navigate away from the page while the animation is playing, it will reset the view to the whole path before the animation is done.
* data processing for provenance mostly looks for the first year listed under each row for the start date of ownership. This works well for most data points that are formatted with both the start date and end date of ownership. Some records only have the end date of ownership (e.g. https://metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436533). For these records, the project currently will attribute that ownership start date as the true end date.
